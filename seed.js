Warm minimalism is different. It keeps the calm of an uncluttered room but brings back the feeling through material, texture and light.", "Start with a narrow, warm palette: creams, oatmeal, soft clay and the honey of natural oak. When everything sits within a few close tones, the eye relaxes and the room feels whole.", "Then layer texture instead of colour — bouclé against smooth plaster, linen against oiled timber, honed stone against wool. The interest comes from how surfaces feel, not from visual noise.", "Finally, light it low and in layers. A single bright ceiling light flattens a room; several warm, low sources give it depth and make even a spare space feel generous."] },

Three things decide how well it ages: the frame, the fill and the fabric.", "The frame is everything. Look for kiln-dried hardwood, joined and glued rather than stapled. It's hidden, but it's the difference between a sofa that holds its shape for years and one that loosens in months.", "For the fill, feather-wrapped foam gives the best balance — the plushness of down with the support of a foam core. Pure foam is firmer and lower-maintenance; pure down is luxurious but needs regular plumping.", "Fabric is where comfort meets real life. Performance weaves and tight bouclés wear beautifully and clean easily. If you have children or pets, choose a removable, washable cover."] },

The trick is to build storage in, so it disappears into the architecture.", "Go full height. Wardrobes and units that run floor to ceiling use otherwise-wasted space and draw the eye up, making the room feel taller.", "Use the in-between spaces — under beds, over doors, the sides of a kitchen island. A little bespoke joinery in these gaps adds up to a lot of hidden storage.", "And keep the fronts calm: handleless, in the same tone as the wall, so storage recedes and the room stays open and quiet."] },

Think in three layers: ambient, task and accent.", "Ambient is your base wash of light — cove lighting, downlights or a soft ceiling fixture. It should be gentle and, ideally, dimmable.", "Task light is focused where you do things — reading, cooking, working. A floor lamp beside a chair or under-cabinet strips in a kitchen.", "Accent light adds mood and drama — a wall light grazing a textured surface, a picture light, a low table lamp. Together, these layers let one room feel completely different at breakfast and at midnight."] },

const FAQS = [
  { q: "How does a project start?", a: "It begins with a free consultation — in person or online. We talk through your taste, needs and budget, then arrange a site survey to measure and assess the space." },
